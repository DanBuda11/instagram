## Instagram Clone

Day 11 project at The Iron Yard. It creates a (very rudimentary) Instagram clone which allows for the posting of images and captions. This was our first use of saving data to a back end server to repopulate the app when a user returns. It is somewhat responsive and has a little bit of validation to confirm the image url is valid before allowing a submission.
